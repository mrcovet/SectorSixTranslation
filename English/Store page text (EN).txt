Sector Six is a side-scrolling, sci-fi shooter with a silhouette aesthetic, procedural loot, extensive customization, and story missions.

Save the Universe
Enter the distant future and join the desperate fight to stop the Eight Machines from destroying everything. In your journey, you will interact with ancient structures and beings, break laws of physics, travel between Sectors, battle swarms of Machine minions, collectors, despair, anomalies, defense systems - all to stop the terrible enemy.

Build your spaceship
Spaceship building allows you to build a unique ship from procedural parts, obtained by destroying minions of the Machines. Every part has various properties and can be placed anywhere on the building field, allowing you to customize performance, appearance, and size of your ship.

Become master of spaceship combat
Test not just your spaceship, but also your skills as you dodge enemy projectiles and find the right timing to counterattack with your own. Each enemy brings new attacks, defenses, and strategies to defeat - itâ€™s up to you to hone your combat skills and take them down.

Part customization, part sets, and relics
Combine, upgrade, and re-roll parts to create new modules that are ideal for your dream spaceship. If that is not enough, collect set parts and relics to transform your destroyer of invaders into something even more powerful!

Modular difficulty system
Make the game as hard as you want it to be! A modular difficulty system allows you to modify almost every element of the combat and offers rewards for increasing the difficulty.
